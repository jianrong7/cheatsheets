Warning: This module has a heavy workload.

I really enjoyed this module. You are pretty much guaranteed to get about 30% of the module because of Source Academy, Studio attendance and the Mastery Checks.
This module is my first introduction to programming and I quite liked it. Prof Kok Lim and Prof Boyd were very enthusiastic and passionate professors. I also liked the
support system provided throughout the module. There were so many channels for students to ask questions. You could ask them on Piazza, to your TAs, to your peers, or
during the lecture itself.

Introduces you to recursion and the idea of problem solving in programming. However, if I could go back in time, I would probably take CS1010X so that I could skip this
module. This module took up the bulk of my time during the semester and there were times where I felt it may not have been worth it. Nevertheless, I think it is a great
introductory module facilitated by passionate professors.
