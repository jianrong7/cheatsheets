- 12 Weekly Online Quizzes: 15%
- 1 Lab Assignment: 5%

There was a lot of content being thrown at us throughout the semester. I did not necessarily understand them right away. However, at the end of the course, I think
everything wrapped up nicely into the "Main Theorem of Invertible Matrices".

My advice would be to keep up with the weekly content. Watch the lectures online and do the quizzes diligently as a test of your understanding. It is okay if you do
not know how to do the proving questions in the tutorials, they can get tricky. But, make sure you know how to do the computations correctly and quickly. Time
will be tight during the final exam.

My TA was good and answered my questions through email very promptly. Don't be afraid to ask! Perhaps being the first math module I took in university, it will feel very different
from what you have done in the past.

Be sure to watch the [3blue1brown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjBOesZCoqc&list=PL0-GT3co4r2y2YErbmuJw2L5tW4Ew2O5B) playlist on linear algebra. They really helped with
my understanding.
