#### Weightage

- Midterm Test: 30%
- Final examination: 50%

I really liked the lecturer, Professor Hanny Kusandi. I have heard some bad things about this mod that it can be boring and can be like steamed chicken breast. (You know it
is good for you, but you still don't like it.) However, Prof Hanny makes the lectures way more fun and interesting. Tutorials were also short but informative. Class participation
was not a must although it is a business module. You don't see people vying to get a chance to get class participation because there was a presentation every group had to do.

I enjoyed this module and it allowed me to break away from the monotonous mathematical rigour of my computer science and math modules. Being interested in businesses, this module
did not feel like extra work. It felt like I was doing my own personal reading and research. Also, we got to analyse Samsung's financial statements throughout the semester. I liked
the real-world aspect of the tutorials.

Generally a lighter module, especially in the first half. The second half can get a bit more tricky, but nothing unreasonable. I highly recommend this module for people who are
interested in accounting/business/finance.
